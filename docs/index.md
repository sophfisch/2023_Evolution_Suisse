Plant pathogens pose a global burden on agriculture, reducing harvest by up to 40% https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/1402920/icode/. Diseased crops not only lead to reduced yield and quality  but ultimately impact the economy and environment (Martins et al., 2018; Savary et al., 2017). 
Currently, pesticides are used to protect crops, however, they negatively impact the  environment and pose health risks to humans (Pathak et al., 2022). Therefore, developing  pathogen-resistant crops remains a challenge that demands innovative solutions and  research.  

Like humans, plants also have a built in immune system. It is the plant's way of protecting itself from harmful invaders, like bacteria or fungi. This defence system relies on detectors called Pattern Recognition Receptors, or PRRs for short. These detectors are like the plant's security guards, and they can recognize certain patterns that are associated with these invaders. These patterns are called PAMPs, which stands for Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns.

Bacteria can introduce proteins called effectors into the plant cells to suppress the functions of the PRRs. Since it is beneficial for a plant to avoid being infected by bacteria, mutations in plants which allow for the PRRs to avoid the attacks of effectors are more likely to stick around. 

Plants and bacteria continuously evolve to avoid being recognized by each other. In nature, plants are very slow at evolving whereas the bacteria can evolve faster. Therefore, this system is too slow for us to have crops which are naturally resistant to bacteria. However, we can shorten the time needed for a crop to evolve resistance by employing directed evolution. Directed evolution is achieved by introducing mutations into an organism's DNA and creating conditions in which only the organisms with the desired traits survive. This is repeated multiple times to ensure the best possible outcome, in our case bacteria-resistant crops.
