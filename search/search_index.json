Diseased crops not only lead to reduced yield and quality but ultimately impact the economy and environment (Martins et al., 2018; Savary et al., 2017). Currently, pesticides are used to protect crops, however, they negatively impact the environment and pose health risks to humans (Pathak et al., 2022). Therefore, developing pathogen-resistant crops remains a challenge that demands innovative solutions and research.  This part might use some more numbers and genral talk about the problem.</p> <p>Plant innate immunity relies on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Boutrot &amp; Zipfel, 2017; Zipfel, 2014). Phytobacteria evade this immune response by introducing virulence proteins called effectors into plant cells via e.g. the type III secretion system to promote pathogenesis (Macho &amp; Zipfel, 2015). As a result, residues on the interaction interfaces find themselves under high selective pressure, facilitating the fixation of interaction-disrupting mutations (Bishop et al., 2000; Bishop et al., 2005; Shabab et el., 2008).</p> <p>This part could be more informative about PRRs in general, what they can do. </p> <p>Among the phytobacteria, Pseudomonas syringae ranks as the scientifically and economically most important bacterial pathogen worldwide (Mansfield et al., 2012). Strains of P. syringae are categorised into at least 50 pathovars and express a variety of effector proteins. One well-characterised effector of P. syringae is AvrPtoB. Besides P. syringae, members of the AvrPtoB protein family are also present in many other strains of Pseudomonas, and at least two other genera of bacterial phytopathogens, Xanthomonas and Erwinia (Oguiza &amp; Asensio, 2005). In Arabidopsis thaliana, AvrPtoB targets the receptor kinase CERK1, which is responsible for chitin elicitor signalling and resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens (Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2009).  CERK1 consists of an extracellular domain with three tandem-LysM motifs, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, and an intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain (Yang et al., 2022). AvrPtoB can repress chitin responses and overcome CERK1-mediated resistance by inhibiting the kinase activity and targeting CERK1 for degradation (Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2009).</p> <p>Here I would detail CERK1 quite a bit more. As well as AvrPtoB. Maybe do a fun: \"Our players\" part.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"project/results/","title":"Results","text":"<p>First, a longer paragraph explaining the rationale, and the situations that arise. More talk about how the system is switchable between the positions and orientations.</p> <p>While trying to replicate the CERK1-AvrPtoB interaction, we obtained differing results depending on which protein was fused to which domain of the Gal4 transcription factor. Namely, when CERK1 and AvrPtoB were fused to the DBD and AD, respectively, we observed a very strong interaction between them, replicating previous results (reference). However, when the DBD and AD were switched between CERK1 and AvrPtoB, the interaction was not replicated. On first glance, this didn\u2019t seem as much of a problem as standard reverse yeast-two hybrid (rY2H) methods described by Vidal et al. or Leanna et al. would permit such constructs. Even though the methods originally intended for the prey protein (CERK1) to be bound to the AD and the bait protein (AvrPtoB) to the DBD, there are no fundamental problems with the fusions being reversed. </p> <p>The problem arises when we consider that our workflow includes an error-prone PCR (epPCR) step, which in essence, introduces random mutations into CERK1. The easiest way for a mutation to disrupt the interaction between CERK1 and AvrPtoB is for it to be a truncating mutation. Such mutations fall into one of two categories: i) substitutions that change a codon specifying for an amino acid to a stop codon, and ii) insertions or deletions which cause the downstream sequence to fall out-of-frame1. Regardless of its type, truncating mutations almost always severely affect the protein\u2019s structure, and in turn its function. Thus, truncating mutations are highly likely to result in a positive readout on the rY2H assay, but they are also just as likely to result in a non-functional CERK1 protein. Unfortunately, these mutations are also very common in rY2H assays, with more than 97% of positive colonies expected to contain truncated alleles (Gray et al., 2007). As the end-goal of our project was to disrupt the CERK1-AvrPtoB interaction, while keeping the original function of CERK1 intact, it was paramount to devise a way to select against truncating mutations.</p> <p>1 In theory, epPCR causes both types of mutations, albeit insertions and deletions are produced at much lower rate (doi: 10.1093/nar/gkh315). </p> <p></p> <p>Present the results for the method development, and be more critical of the ability to discern truncations. Talk about possible reasons.</p> <p>I would present MYTH adaptation right bellow ours just to keep them in the same place.</p>"}]}
